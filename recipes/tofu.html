        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Packed with flavor and extremely satisfying, tofu masala 
            is another standard in our household. The baked tofu also
            tastes good on salads, so this is almost like a 2-in-1 recipe!
            Great for cozy rainy or snowy days, a genuine comfort meal.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400&#176; and line a baking sheet with
                parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, combine garam masala, turmeric, curry
                powder, paprika, and salt; mix to combine. In a seperate 
                larger bowl, combine yogurt and <strong>half</strong> of
                spice mixture; mix well. Add tofu and gently toss to coat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange yogurt-coated tofu pieces on baking sheet in a 
                single layer so that they aren't touching. Bake in the center 
                rack for 30 minutes, turning the tofu after 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the tofu bakes, heat oil in a large skillet over medium
                heat. Once hot, add onions and cook until soft and translucent.
                Stir in tomato paste, garlic, ginger, and remaining spice 
                mixture. Cook 2 more minutes, stirring often, until the paste 
                turns brick red and begins to stick to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add broth, tomato sauce, and coconut milk. Whisk to combine.
                Gently simmer masala sauce, uncovered, until is reduces and
                thickens, about 12 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove tofu from oven and transfer to masala sauce, stirring to
                coat. Serve over rice and garnish with fresh cilantro.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>*To press tofu without a tofu press, place between paper
            towels, and then between two baking sheets. Place something
            heavy on top (a pile of books or a bowl full of water) for 
            10-20 mintues.</em></p>

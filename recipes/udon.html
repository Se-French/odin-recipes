            <li>2 large chopped carrots</li>
            <li>1 package udon noodles</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce or liquid aminos</li>
            <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil (or any neutral cooking oil)</li>
            <li><em>Optional</em> 2 soft boiled eggs <em>and/or</em> up to 1 cup edamame</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick pan or
                wok. Add the peppers, onions, mushrooms, and 
                carrots. Cook on medium to medium-high heat, 
                stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes (or 
                until mushrooms are nearly cooked through). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the broccolini and cook for another 2-3
                minutes. If using edamame, add that now as well. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add soy sauce, sesame oil, and hoisin. Stir until
                well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add noodles to pan and cook for another 3-4 minutes
                or until noodles separate and soften. Stir almost 
                continuously to evenly coat noodles in sauce. Adjust
                sauce to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and serve. Top with 
                soft boiled egg.
            </li>
        </ol>
